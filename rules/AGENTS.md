# Core Rule for Vibes-Plug Agents

## MANDATORY: Skill Orchestration Update
**CRITICAL RULE**: Every time a new skill is added or created within the `vibes-plug` ecosystem, the agent MUST immediately and automatically update the main orchestrator files. 

Failure to do so breaks the entire architectural orchestration flow.

Whenever a new skill `SKILL.md` is generated, you must:
1. **Update `brainstorming/SKILL.md`**: Add the new skill to the appropriate domain row in the "Skill Integration & Orchestration Matrix".
2. **Update `zero-to-prod-orchestrator/SKILL.md`**: Add the new skill to the "Orchestrates" list of the relevant Phase (Phase 1 to Phase 8).
3. **Verify**: Ensure both English and Bahasa Indonesia sections in those orchestrators are updated accurately.

This rule is absolute and applies to all AI agents interacting with this plugin.
